A stylized dragon creature, based on a [2D artwork](https://www.instagram.com/p/BoL7ysilHQe/) by [Sam Nassour](https://samnassour.com/).

It was my first time doing a strongly stylized design, and I enjoyed figuring out the various shapes and details in ZBrush.  
I textured it with Mari, its brushes were useful for getting the right stylized look to the texture.

Rendered in Unreal Engine, with a bit of post process work in Affinity Photo.
