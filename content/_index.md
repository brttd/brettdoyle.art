I especially enjoy digital organic sculpting.
I have skills in hard-surface, environment, and creature modeling, both high and low-poly.
I've recently finished studying with CG Spectrum, in their Diploma of [Advanced 3D Modeling](https://www.cgspectrum.edu.au/online-courses/zbrush-digital-sculpting-classes/) course.
