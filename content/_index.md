I'm a 20 year old programmer & 3D artist, living in London.

I especially enjoy digital organic sculpting.
I have skills in hard-surface, environment, and creature modeling, both high and low-poly.
Last year I completed CG Spectrum's Diploma of [Advanced 3D Modeling](https://www.cgspectrum.edu.au/online-courses/zbrush-digital-sculpting-classes/).
